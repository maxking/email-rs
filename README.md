email-rs
==========

Rust library to parse and generate emails. For starters, this will mostly
conform to RFC 2822. Once we are successfully there, I will try to move on to
implement other MIME formats.

State
------

The library is in very early stages of development and the author is trying to
learn Rust using this as a toy project. Any suggestions on the code is welcome
but I would strongly suggest not to use this in any application since there is
no stable API yet.

Pull Requests to fix my syntax and/or logic is welcome! 

Feature requests at this point is not welcome, thanks!
